# MongoDBInventory
MongoDBInvetory is a web application, like a product inventory, that allows you to add, delete or modify Amazon products or view all their information. The products are stored in MongoDB (a NoSQL database), in a collection called AmazonProducts.
The development of this application aims to learn how to use MongoDB and use the index concept on stored data.
